  <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00ccff;">That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</span></h2>
  <img src="https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/That-Time-I-Got-Reincarnated-As-A-Slime-Season-2-release-date-Tensei-Shitara-Slime-Datta-Ken-manga-light-novel-series-compared-to-the-TenSura-isekai-anime-Spoilers-Low-Res.jpg" alt="cover-art" width="550">
  <p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>Description: </strong>"Satoru Mikami, an average 37 year old office worker from Tokyo with no girlfriend, was asked for marriage advice by his colleague Tamura. After meeting him and his partner Miho on the street, he is stabbed to death by a passing robber. After making some requests during his death, he is reincarnated in another world as a slime with the ability known as predator (which can devour other creatures and obtain their abilities). Upon making friends with the dragon Veldora, the slime, now known as Rimuru Tempest, embarks on a journey to find a way to free Veldora from his seal, encountering many different races along the way (along with embarking on side quests throughout the story)." This is both a manga and an anime, but I'll just review the manga part. So the story is about a slime who has the unique abilities [Predator] and [Great Sage]. [Predator] allows him to absorb tons of things and do many other things with the absorbed things. [Great Sage] allows him to talk to a voice in his head which is basically a magical Alexa. Upon venturing out into the world, Rimuru ends up as the leader of a bunch of monsters. Rimuru's goal in his new life is to make new friends and form friendly bonds with human countries, and along the way many things happen.<strong>Review:</strong> My review on this this manga is that it is fun to read, and as well as having comedy, it also has quite a few moments which can hit you in the feels. I'll admit to watching the anime before reading the manga, but I really enjoyed it overall. Also reading past where the anime left off, no spoilers, but the story really picked up and I enjoyed reading ahead (although it doesn't go too far ahead in the English translation.)</span></p>
  <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00ccff;">I Am The Sorcerer King</span></h2>
  <img src="https://f01.mrcdn.info/file/mrportal/j/6/8/c/ox.gEXuPf5p.png" alt="cover-art" width="550">
 <p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>Description: </strong>"10 years ago, the monster horde from the rift formed from space and time started attacking the mankind. At the same time, people have started to awaken the power and began hunting the monsters for fame and money Lee SungHoon, in need of money because of his mother’s sickness, takes a dangerous job to help hunt those monsters four times a month by acting as a bait for the hunters But one day, he is heavily injured by a monster and remembers his past life as a sorcerer king ‘Huh? Did I just die?» ‘Wait, I was a Sorcerer King Kratraus in my previous life?’ With his past memories, SungHoon’s overpowered magic show begins" That basically sums it up for this manga, onto the review. <strong>Review: </strong>The manhwa has a solid plot with plenty of redeeming features for power fantsy junkies like myself. One part of this story that made it enjoyable in the fact that there is a type of level up system but the main character kind of 'cheats' around it by using his other world knowledge. I would reccomend this to fans of Solo Leveling. The manwha stays relatively serious without too much comedy but is still quite enjoyable to read.</span></p>
  <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00ccff;">Talentless Nana</span></h2>
  <img src="https://f01.mrcdn.info/file/mrportal/j/1/r/3/MJ.e0NI9r7V.jpg" alt="cover-art" width="550">
  <p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>Description: </strong>"It is the year 20XX. Earth has been assulted by monsters known as 'the Enemy of Humanity'. In order to deal with this threat, special schools comprised of teenagers with extraordinary abilities were formed. These people, who came to be known as 'The Talented', have abilities that defy the rules of reality. Among those superpowered individuals was an outlier, someone who was sent to one of these schools despite having no innate special abilities whatsoever. This is the story of our protagonist, who attempts to defeat the Enemies of Humanity through the use of intelligence and manipulation." <strong>Warning:</strong>This story which may be a little much to those who aren't fans of the thriller/horror genres may want to avoid reading this manga. There is also quite a bit of violence and crime solving so be warned. <strong>Review: </strong>Talentless Nana is the story of a talentless girl hiding her talent in order to pursue her goal. The story of the manga is pretty interesting in the fact that it takes a different point of view on superpowers. Overall the story is a fun one to read and is pretty suspenseful sometimes. </span></p>
