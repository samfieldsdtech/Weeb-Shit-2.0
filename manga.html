  <p><span style="color: #00ccff;">"Satoru Mikami, an average 37 year old office worker from Tokyo with no girlfriend, was asked for marriage advice by his colleague Tamura. After meeting him and his partner Miho on the street, he is stabbed to death by a passing robber. After making some requests during his death, he is reincarnated in another world as a slime with the ability known as predator (which can devour other creatures and obtain their abilities). Upon making friends with the dragon Veldora, the slime, now known as Rimuru Tempest, embarks on a journey to find a way to free Veldora from his seal, encountering many different races along the way (along with embarking on side quests throughout the story)." This is both a manga and an anime, but I'll just review the manga part. So the story is about a slime who has the unique abilities [Predator] and [Great Sage]. [Predator] allows him to absorb tons of things and do many other things with the absorbed things. [Great Sage] allows him to talk to a voice in his head which is basically a magical Alexa. Upon venturing out into the world, Rimuru ends up as the leader of a bunch of monsters. Rimuru's goal in his new life is to make new friends and form friendly bonds with human countries, and along the way many things happen.<strong>Review:</strong> My review on this this manga is that it is fun to read, and as well as having comedy, it also has quite a few moments which can hit you in the feels. I'll admit to watching the anime before reading the manga, but I really enjoyed it overall. Also reading past where the anime left off, no spoilers, but the story really picked up and I enjoyed reading ahead (although it doesn't go too far ahead in the English translation.)</span></p>
